# Tic-Tac-Toe-game/ X and O game

In this mini project, I created first the table board game - 3 lines and 3 columns. I created the table in HTML.

The player that has the 1st move is X, as per the rules of the game and, after X will be O's turn, than again X and they will exchange roles until the end of the game.

The winner of the game will be the one that clicks all the 3 cells (in line/ column or diagonal) and, in case we have a winner, a message will be displayed, congratulating the winner.

In case we have no winner but all the cells have been clicked, we have a draw game and a message will be displayed, accordingly.

In each of the 2 cases mentioned above, the players can choose to play once again - just by pressing a button!

During the game, I also have a text message, displaying who's turn is to move.

At the implementation of this project, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
